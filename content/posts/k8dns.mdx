# Part Four: Local DNS Configuration

To access Pi-Hole admin, we are now going to deploy an Ingress, responsible of making accessible a service from outside the cluster by mapping an internal service:port to a host. To choose a host, we need to configure a DNS like we did for NextCloud “nextcloud.domain.com” in the previous article. However, unlike NextCloud, Pi-Hole have no reason to be exposed on the Internet, we can pick a host that will be resolved internally to our Nginx proxy (available at 192.168.0.240 : LoadBalancer IP). The simplest solution is to use nip.io which allows us to map an IP (in our case 192.168.0.240) to a hostname without touching /etc/hosts or configuring a DNS. Basically it resolves anything.ip.nip.io by ip without requiring anything else, Magic !
